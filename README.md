# 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge!   
I'm committing to coding **at least 1 hour every day for 100 days**, following the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) by **Angela Yu** on Udemy.
